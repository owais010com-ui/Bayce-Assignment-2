                BORED APE YACHT CLUB
            </h1>
            <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum
                blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only
                benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and
                perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation</p>

            <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including
                expression,
                headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope, but some are rarer than others.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. <a href="">(See
                    Record
                    and Proof.) </a>
                Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> To access members-only areas such as <a href="">THE BATHROOM</a> , Apeholders will need to be signed
                into
                their Metamask Wallet.

            membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve
            as your digital identity, and open digital doors for you.</p>

            <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas
                accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the
                place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as
                a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of
                crypto twitter.</p>
